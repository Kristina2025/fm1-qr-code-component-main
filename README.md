## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about setting the width and height of elemenents. I used fixed values, where I should be more flexible with the sizes so that they work well on different screens. One solution is to set:

```css
.card {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 32rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to keep working on HTML and CSS, until I master the basics better.

### Useful resources
